This is what I did to uninstall kali nethunter (rootless) installed with termux on my android.
Not sure if this will work for you!! I was not able to find any other solution to uninstall it.

First open termux and type ls in the home directory.
After that check if there is a nethunter installer, like this one:

install-nethunter-termux

it will be in green font color normally.

Now just run this installer, type: bash install-nethunter-termux
Now you will be prompted that:

a rootfs file already exist, do you want to delete and install new rootfs file? (similar to this)

Now here is the trick:
type y and start the process, the installer will first delete the already existing nethunter-rootfs file and will start downloading it again, 
but before its starts downloading just type ctrl^c and end the process. (do it on time before the downloading begins)
Kali Nethunter will be uninstalled.

if the downloading began and you were not able to cancel it on time, you will have to remove the downloaded file:
the downloaded file will be:

nethunter-rootfs.tar.gz

Remove it with this command: pkg remove nethunter-rootfs.tar.gz

if you have other kali file remove it with pkg remove <pkgname>

type : nh and also check the storage space before and after the process and confirm that it is indeed uninstalled.
